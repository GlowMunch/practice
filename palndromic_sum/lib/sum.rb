# A palindrome is any number, word, or phrase that reads the same forward as it does backward. In this challenge, we are going to focus on palindromic numbers.
# For example, 12321 is a palindromic number, whereas 123 is not.

# Write a method/function that starts at 0 and finds the first twenty-five numbers where the number plus its inverse equals a palindrome that is greater than 1,000.
# 47(number) + 74(inverse) = 121(palindrome) Note: This does not meet the greater than 1,000 rule.
# Collect the twenty-five numbers in an array as the return value. Be sure to collect the number and not the sum.
# Bonus: Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, see if you can create a solution without converting the numbers to strings/arrays.


#take each number
#make into an of each number in set, so 500 would be  [5, 0, 0]
#then .reverse the array

#bring back together as whole number
#add new value to original value
#check if its over 1000

#turn into an array
#example 1000 would be [1,0,0,0]

#check if index 0 and index .last are equal

#if there is an index position 3
#check if index 1 and 2 are equal
